# Hangman-game 

For my advanced programming project, I have decided to implement the game of hangman. Hangman is where a player guesses a word which is chosen by another player. The guesser gets to know the length of the word and tries to guess the word in a certain number of attempts. On every wrong guess, a drawing of a hanging man increases until it is a full drawing. Once the drawing is complete, the game is over.
